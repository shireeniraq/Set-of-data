# Set-of-data
The data in this study demonstrate how the number of flowering plants, the population of honey-producing bees, and the quantity of honey change over time under the influence of high wind conditions, using a three-variable differential model. The data capture the behavior of each component of the ecosystem, including plant growth, bee reproduction, and honey production, as well as the decline in these values when wind intensity increases. These data are used to examine stability, structural transitions, and the potential extinction of one of the system’s components under changing environmental conditions, making them a foundation for analyzing the interaction dynamics between plants and bees.
